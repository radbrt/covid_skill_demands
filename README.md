# Estimating skill demands

This is a work in progress attempt at using NER to estimate skill demands in job ads before and after the covid outbreak. Working from home may have had a significant impact on the skill demand, which we are trying to measure.

Although the repo contains an article.html file, this file may not be up to date. The analysis is run automatically on each commit to master, and saved in a cloud bucket.

Some data is too large to include in the repo, with time this will be included in a cloud bucket made available to anyone. For now, the `data/jobs_small.feather` should be sufficient.
